# GitStarRecall - UI Alignment Checklist

Use this checklist to ensure the implementation matches the HTML/CSS baseline in `rought-UI-design`.

## 1) Layout and Structure
- The top-level layout matches the design (header, main content, status/side areas).
- Spacing and page rhythm are consistent with the baseline.
- Sections appear in the same order and hierarchy.
- Landing page and usage page are distinct and follow the intended flow.
- Landing page is public and includes a demo video section.

## 2) Typography
- Font families match the baseline.
- Font sizes and weights are consistent for headings, body, and UI labels.
- Line-height and letter spacing look consistent with the baseline.

## 3) Color and Theme
- Primary, secondary, and neutral colors match the baseline.
- Backgrounds, borders, and shadows match the baseline.
- Disabled and hover states are visible and consistent.

## 4) Components
- Buttons match size, padding, and hover states.
- Inputs match border, focus style, and placeholder style.
- Cards and result items match spacing and typography.

## 5) Results List

- Pagination or infinite scroll matches the baseline (if present).

## 6) Responsiveness
