# Release Notes

## 2026-02-23

- Fixed disappearing chat history after refresh by adding resilient chat backup storage:
  - primary backup in IndexedDB
  - fallback backup in localStorage when IndexedDB is unavailable
- Wired backup writes into chat persistence paths (`upsertChatSession`, `addChatMessage`) so backup is updated even if primary DB persistence later fails.
- Added restore fallback in Usage page: if SQLite/OPFS history is empty or restore fails, chat sessions/messages are recovered from backup.
- Added restore-source visibility in UI (`sqlite`, `indexeddb`, or `local-storage`) for diagnostics.
- Updated clear-data behavior to wipe chat backup copies along with local DB storage.
- Added tests for chat backup fallback/pruning/clear behavior.

## 2026-02-22

- Fixed chat history restore after refresh + PAT re-auth by rerunning deterministic local restore on auth transition.
- Added explicit history restore state in UI and persisted `history_last_restored_at` metadata.
- Clarified restored-history vs in-memory retrieval context behavior and added one-click rehydrate action for empty in-memory results.
- Persisted minimal retrieval context IDs per session (`session_context_ids:<sessionId>`) for continuity/debugging.
- Consolidated Vite config usage to `vite.config.ts` and prevented `vite.config.js` drift.
