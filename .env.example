# Optional: key used to encrypt the stored LLM API key in localStorage (e.g. 32-byte hex or base64).
# If set, the remote provider API key is stored encrypted (bound to session + this key); if unset, the API key is not persisted.
# Note: this value is embedded in the client bundle; it protects against casual exfiltrators that only read localStorage, not against attackers with access to the app source.
